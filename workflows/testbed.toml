# Testbed Instance Configuration
#
# [testbed] section: required, defines the testbed instance context
#
# Override sections: Any section matching a workflow config section will override
# those values. Section names are descriptive (e.g., [daq_state_machine],
# [fast_processing]) so overrides are unambiguous.

[testbed]
# Namespace for this testbed instance.
# Must be set before running workflows - empty string will cause an error.
# Examples: "epic-fastmon-dev", "collab-dec29", "wenauseic-test1"
#
# Multiple users can collaborate in one namespace.
# Users are responsible for namespace uniqueness.
namespace = "torre1"

# Example: Override fast_processing settings for this testbed
# [fast_processing]
# stf_count = 5                   # Fewer STF files for quick testing
#
# Example: Override daq_state_machine timing for this testbed
# [daq_state_machine]
# stf_interval = 1.0              # Faster STF generation
