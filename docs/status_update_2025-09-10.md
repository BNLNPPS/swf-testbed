# Processing Agent – Status Update (2025-09-10)

## Purpose
Provide a robust pipeline that:
- Listens for real-time data notifications
- Organizes files into Rucio datasets
- Submits distributed jobs to PanDA
- Reports status and metrics to the workflow monitor

## System Architecture
- **Message Queue:** Subscribes to ActiveMQ for run and file events
- **Data Management:** Uses Rucio to group files into datasets with full metadata
- **Batch Computing:** Submits jobs to the PanDA distributed computing system
- **Monitoring:** Reports health and progress continuously to the monitor

## Operational Workflow
1. **Run Preparation:** Opens a new dataset when a run is announced
2. **Data Collection:** Attaches STF files as they arrive
3. **Batch Submission:** Closes the dataset at run completion and submits a single PanDA job
4. **Execution:** Runs analysis scripts on compute nodes with run metadata

## Testing & Validation
Automated test injection covers:
- Single-file datasets
- Multi-file datasets (validated with 5 files)
- Timing stress (rapid-fire message delivery)
- Error handling (missing checksums, null sizes, edge cases)

**Results:**
- Multi-file test: 5-file datasets processed correctly
- Rucio verification: Dataset contents and metadata confirmed
- End-to-end validation: ActiveMQ → Rucio → PanDA workflow successful with simulated data

## Current Status
- **Infrastructure:** End-to-end workflow validated with test data
- **Integration:** ActiveMQ → Rucio → PanDA pipeline fully functional
- **Jobs:** Submitted tasks (e.g., 17957, 17958) with correct metadata
- **Reliability:** Automatic reconnection handles ActiveMQ timeouts
- **Coverage:** All workflow scenarios tested, including error conditions

### Summary
We now have a reliable, dataset-driven pipeline that ingests streaming data files, organizes them in Rucio, and submits efficient batch jobs to PanDA.
